# Zowser

Zowser separates the gallery logic in the [OME-NGFF 2024 challenge](https://github.com/ome/ome2024-ngff-challenge) into a standalone application. 

It is similar in spirit and purpose to other open-source OME-Zarr galleries, like: 

* [Zallery](https://github.com/openssbd/zallery)
* [Zarrcade](https://github.com/JaneliaSciComp/zarrcade)
  
and to some extent, with the "sharing" part of 

* [BioFileFinder](https://bff.allencell.org/) 

Each of them has slightly different user experiences, use cases, tech stacks and UI. 

And they all collaborate with each other.

## General design goals

* (D0) Allow deployment of small, custom sets of images for sharing

* (D1) Work with any set of public OME-Zarr Image available on S3-like storage. Coverage of data in versions 0.4 and 0.5 (and later depending on capacity)

* (D2) Use only GitHub infrastructure
  
* (D3) Deploy new instances changing only a single configuration file

* (D4) Fast load and browsing

* (D5) Stretch goal of supporting machine-readable documentation of the data (e.g. via RO-Crate)
 
## Implementation

* Build upon [OME-NGFF 2024 challenge](https://github.com/ome/ome2024-ngff-challenge), Svelte, deploy on GH Pages (D1, D2)

* Add a config file `config.yaml` that describes metadata for the instance and basic metadata for the files (D0, D2, D3)

* A "hydration" step for caching metadata (zarr.json, ro-crate-metadata.json) and thumbnails (D4, D5)

## Code 

This is a Svelte.js app for loading CSV file(s) that list NGFF samples and
displaying a summary.

Development: cd into this directory, then...

```
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```
